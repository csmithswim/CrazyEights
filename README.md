Java command line game based upon the card game Crazy Eight's.

Crazy 8's Game Rules:
A player wins when they do not have any more cards in their hand.
To start the game, a traditional 52 card playing deck is shuffled and each player is dealt eight cards. The top card of the 
deck is drawn and placed face up next to the dealing deck.
Players take turns discarding cards that match the discard pile according to these three rules:
The discarded card must match the pile's suit, rank or be an eight.
If it is an eight, the player can choose the suit to be changed to a different suit and the discarded card is treated like that card.
For instance, if an eight of clubs is played and the player wants to change the suit to diamonds then the next player must discard a card 
that is an eight or a card that has a diamonds suit.
If a player holds cards with multiple matching ranks then they can play as many of those cards. 
For instance, if a player has a ten of hearts, a ten of spades and the discard pile is a 2 of hearts then the player can play both tens.
A player draws a card until he can discard a card.
