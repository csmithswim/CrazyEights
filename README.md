Crazy 8's Game Rules:
A player wins when they do not have any more cards in their hand.

TO START GAME: Players draw 8 cards from a standard 52 card deck and one 
card is drawn from the top of the deck and placed face up on board.

TO START TURN:
Players can play any card on top of the game's card 

IF first card is an eight then any card can be put down

It matches the same suite || it is the same rank || it is an eight
    IF a card can be played and there are other cards with the same rank in a players hand, 
    then those can be played as well.
    IF it is an eight then the player can decide which suit to change it to. 
    The next player must play a card with that matching suit despite the card having a different suit.
ELSE: Player draws up to 3 cards until they can play a card, if they do not have any cards they can play
then their turn is passed.

The deck gets shuffled once it is gone.

Online versions allow a sort/display of each player's hands
